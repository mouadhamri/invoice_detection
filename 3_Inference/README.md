# invoice_detection: Inference
In this step, we test our detector invoices images located in [`invoice_detection/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images). If you like to test the detector on your own images or videos, place them in the [`Test_Images`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Images) folder. 

## Testing Your Detector
To detect objects run the detector script from within the [`invoice_detection/3_Inference`](/3_Inference/) directory:.
```
python Detector.py
```
The outputs are saved to [`invoice_detection/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results). The outputs include the original images with bounding boxes and confidence scores as well as a file called [`Detection_Results.csv`](/Data/Source_Images/Test_Image_Detection_Results/Detection_Results.csv) containing the image file paths and the bounding box coordinates. For videos, the output files are videos with bounding boxes and confidence scores. To list available command line options run `python Detector.py -h`.
